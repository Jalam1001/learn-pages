# LearnPages

This repository exists to explain — by example — how GitHub Pages works.

Nothing here is theoretical.
This repository itself will become a live website.

## What this repo will demonstrate

- How a GitHub repository becomes a website
- Why URLs look like `username.github.io/repo-name/`
- What files GitHub Pages actually serves
- How `index.html` controls the page you see

## Key idea

GitHub Pages is just static file hosting.

If a repository contains web files and Pages is enabled,
GitHub serves those files at a predictable URL.

This repo is intentionally simple so the mechanism is visible.
